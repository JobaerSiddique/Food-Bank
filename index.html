It was really delicious taste with great quality, everything had unique taste which we had ordered, nice arrangement and services from the staff while eating, we found nothing bad about this hotel.We also ordered chocolate shake which was not that good . I didn't like the chocolate shake .The amount of chocolate and sugar and milk was not right ,it felt like i was drinking chocolate with water. </p>
